# PyCraft Backend Server Bukkit Plugin

This is a more modern backend server that does not 
attempt to provide support for older scripts written
to the mcpi api, instead it attempts to provide a 
solid foundation for writing Minecraft manipulation
code from Python.

## Build Process

```
mvn -e package
